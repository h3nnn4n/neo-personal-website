TODO:
- Buying first expensive keyboard
- It drank a lot of coke, then died to a drop of water
- Rebuilding it
    - Backplate was the pcb. Lots of unsoldering
- Wiring it
- Bugs due to io pins not being fast enough
- How it held up over time
    - Mostly resoldering a pin that cracked every now and then (due to stress from not having a backplate)
