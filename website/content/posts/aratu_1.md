I once read something along the lines of "some people can only live they
childhood dreams after they become adults". Well, child me really liked robots
and wanted to build some. Of course at the time I didn't have the know-how nor
the resources required. Heck, much of the technology available today didn't
even exist back then or wasn't available commercialy at a developing country
like Brazil. Now, a lot has changed. We have microcontrollers 10x faster than
computers were back then, and they are wide available worldwide (when there
isn't a chip shortage going on anyways). I am also fortunate enough to be able
to afford to build a relativelly complex robot, and more importantly I have
developed all the skills and meta skills.
