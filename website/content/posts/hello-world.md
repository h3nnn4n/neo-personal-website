Hey there. Recently I started working at [JobScore](https://www.jobscore.com/)
while I was working at my masters degree on
[Applied Computing](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgca).
This marked a new stage of my life. One that I am not familiar with, since I
just graduated and never worked before. One of my main fears when I started
working, was stopping evolving as a person and as an employee. With that in
mind, I took a few commitments with the goal of creating healthy and productive
habbits for my new life:

- Wake up at 6am, everyday
- Publish at least on commit to github (preferentially code)
- Use my stand desk more
- Exercise at least on time per day
- Decide what I am going to buy/eat before entering the stabilishment
- Save money every month
- Be more environment-friendly
- Have long and short term plan goals

With these commitments and some effort I think that I can improve my life style
and achieve something good on the long run. This blog probably won't be updated
with too much personal stuff. This post was just an official commitment that I
wanted to record.
