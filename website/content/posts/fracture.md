Previously I worked on [cracks](/post/cracks/), which was a reinterpretation of
[fractures](https://inconvergent.net/generative/fractures/), by
[inconvergent.net](https://inconvergent.net/). My goal originally was to
eventually reproduce his work, as an exercise. I stopped halfway there with
something that I was satisfied with even though I will want to reproduce it
somewhere in the future. From the partially finished reimplementation, I had
the idea of using a picture to get the colors to fill in the spaces. The
intention was to recreate a picture using a mosaic-like pattern generated by
the cracks/fractures. Unfortunately, I was not able to do it fast enough using
JavaScript.  The partial result can be seen below. One can click the canvas to
restart the drawing process and generate new images.
