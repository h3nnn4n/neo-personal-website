Hey there. I am Renan S Silva, also known as `h3nnn4n` or `bacon_unleased` /
`bacon_unleashed`, depending on where you know me from. I received my bachelor
degree on Computer Science from the
[State University of Santa Catarina](https://www.udesc.br/) on august 2017.
Immediately after that I started a master's degree in
[Applied Computing](https://www.udesc.br/cct/ppgca) working with the Ab Initio
protein structure problem, which I concluded 2 years after.

Currently I work full time as a Software Engineer on
[Tesorio](https://tesorio.com/), where I am part of a small and nimble team
responsible by platform work and maintenance of several integrations with
external systems, as well as developing new ones.

I am a man of many hobbies. I have a strong passion for puzzles, specially
twisty ones, like the Rubik's Cube. I love cats and coffee. I play drums and do
origami. I like biking and hiking. I love artificial intelligence, optimization
and machine learning (looks like everyone nowadays does).

Another thing that I do really enjoy is creative coding, which I have been
doing on and off for more than 10 years. IIRC I started it around 2007~2008,
kidding around with QBasic and some trigonometry. A special kind of creative
coding that I tend to do a lot is to fractals and strange / chaotic attractors
as the main object in the piece. If you look around this page you will find a
couple of examples. My github also has a lot of code about it too.

Here is a random picture of my puzzle collection (the cat is a specially hard
one).
