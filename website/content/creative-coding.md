### Fractals

- Rust powered and web based __Mandelbrot set explorer__. Supports 3 rendering
  modes and antialiasing. Mainly an exercise on using Rust/wasm to do
  something cool.
  - [Browser version](/mandelbrot-explorer)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/h3nnn4n/Mandelbrot-Explorer)

### Strange Attractors

- Rust powered and web based __Clifford Attractor explorer__. Has some basic
  color selection.  Supports parameter interpolation. Can also use
  [Lyapunov Exponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent) to automatically
  generate random cool configurations.  Mainly an exercise on using Rust/wasm
  to do something cool.

### Others

- __Dancing room__: My interpretation of the "Dancing with Friends" emergent
  behavior demonstration. It uses matter.js to simulate physics.
  - [Browser version](/post/dancing-room)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/h3nnn4n/Dancing-Rooms)

- __Dancing room zero__: One of the collest pieces of emergent behaviour I ever
  saw. This is a reimplementation on a post that I saw many years ago. It is
  not 99%, but close enough I guess.
  - [Browser version](/post/dancing-room-zero)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/h3nnn4n/dancing-friends-zero)

- __Cracks__: Supposed to mimic cracked glass. Doesn't work very well.
  - [Browser version](/post/cracks)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/h3nnn4n/cracks)

<br>

- __Fracture__: A set of random "fractures" that attempts to draw a painting.
  Doesn't work very well.
  - [Browser version](/post/fracture)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/h3nnn4n/fracture)

- __Flow field__: Particles are free to move around in a vector field that is being
  manipulated by perlin noise.  This is one of the very first programs I ever
  wrote with javascript.
  - [Browser version](/posts/flow)
  - [Source code](https://github.com/h3nnn4n/flow-net)
