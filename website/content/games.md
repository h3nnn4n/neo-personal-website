### Shootaroo

Fast paced game with a heavy focus on hand-eye coordination and ambidexterity.
The player must defend against a never ending onslaught of abstract enemies and
try to get the highest score possible.

Will be published to Steam by august. Check
[shootaroo.xyz](https://shootaroo.xyz) for more.

This is my first attempt at a comercial game. It was born out of a self
challenge to publish a game. Despite the game simplicity, getting it ready for
publishing helped me to develop several skills and learn new things.

### The adventures of Gosmae and the magical ooze

A game made for the [GMTK 2021 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021) with
the theme "Joined Together".  In this game the player takes control of Gosmãe,
the mother of all goo, and must reconnect the life pedestals together to
rekindle magic in a dying world. For that, Gosmãe can use the magic ooze to
build bridges and reach the far away pedestals.
