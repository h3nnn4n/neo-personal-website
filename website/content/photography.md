Photography has been something that I have been interested in for several years
now, and I even made some attempts at doing it. My mistake was not documenting
it, and without a history, it is much harder to track progress and learn from
past experiences. This page is my attempt at keeping track of my photography
work. Don't expect to find anything amazing here, but hopefully, quality should
improve over time.

Sorry if the page is a bit broken, I am still working on it.
