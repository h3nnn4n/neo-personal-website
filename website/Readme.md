# Neo personal website

A silly implementation of my old personal website at
[h3nnn4n.me](https://h3nnn4n.me). The old version as based on hugo, which while
quite powerful, I never quite learned how to properly use. Furthermore, often I
found myself wanting or actually building things for it that required a backend
/ database. This lead me to have multiple random aws lambdas and other services
scattered around for one off things. Not knowing (and not wanting to learn)
hugo led me to not work on it as much too.

Based on all this, I decided to redo my website using boring tech that I am
very familiar with: nginx, python, django. While it is almost silly to have a
mostly static website running off django, it is what I am more familiar with
and requires the least amount of my brain cells to maintain.

If you want to use this for some reason, go ahead. But beware that this is a
pile of hacks that was never intended to be used by anyone but me.
